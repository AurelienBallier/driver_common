  <description brief="Framework used by all drivers.">
    
    This stack contains a framework that will be used by all the driver
    packages. Functionality includes:

    - Classes for helping to publish consistent diagnostics (each topic
    will publish certain diagnostics, each driver will publish certain
    diagnostics, etc.), and to make diagnostics less tedious to write.

    - Classes for helping to run self-tests and publish their results.

    - A dynamic reconfiguration system to allow driver parameters to be
    changed without taking down the driver, and to autogenerate parameter
    documentation.

    - A base class for sensors to provide a consistent state machine
    (retries, error handling, etc.) and interface.
