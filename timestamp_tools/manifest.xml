  <description brief="Classes to facilitate timestamping of sensor data.">
    <tt>timestamp_tools</tt> provides:
    
    <ul>
    <li>
      a <tt>PeriodicTimestampMinFilter</tt>, which takes a stream of timestamps with
    a known period that may occasionally have been arbitrarily delayed, and
    outputs a stream of timestamps in which the arbitrary delays have been
    filtered out using a min filter.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <tt>TriggerMatcher</tt>, that matches a stream of data structures with
    approximate timestamps to a stream of exact timestamps.
    </li>
    </ul>
