  <description brief="Classes to facilitate timestamping of sensor data.">
    This package provides:
    
    - a PeriodicTimestampMinFilter, which takes a stream of timestamps with
    a known period that may occasionally have been arbitrarily delayed, and
    outputs a stream of timestamps in which the arbitrary delays have been
    filtered out using a min filter.
    
    - a TriggerMatcher, that matches a stream of data structures with
    approximate timestamps to a stream of exact timestamps.
