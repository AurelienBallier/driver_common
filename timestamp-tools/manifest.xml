  <description brief="Classes to facilitate timestamping of sensor data.">
    This package provides:
    
    - a FrameTimeFilter, which takes a stream of approximate timestamps and
    a theoretical period and outputs a stream of corrected timestamps
    
    - a TriggerSynchronizer, which matches a stream of approximate timestamps
    with a timestamp topic.
